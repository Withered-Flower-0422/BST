## Current Version

-   v1.5.1

## Usage

-   Put the `_Typings` folder and `jsconfig.json` file in `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Mushreb\BME Pro HDRP\Assets\Scripts`.

-   If you don't want type checking during coding:
    -   Ignore one line: add `// @ts-ignore` above the line you want to ignore.
    -   Ignore the whole file: add `// @ts-nocheck` at the top of the file.
    -   Ignore every file: change the `checkJS` setting in `jsconfig.json` to `false`.
